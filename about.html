        <!--<p>Yup, that's me. You're probably wondering how I ended up in this situation.<br>
            Well it all started back in 2012, when I began considering to run for president...</p>
        <p>On a serious note, let me tell you about myself:</p>-->
        <div class="Article">
            <p>I am <a id="OwnerName">Hunter Land</a>, I am a dual-parnership program student and will
            be transfering to OSU at the start of next year. I began to code (very lightly) at age 9
            but from there have just kept going. I started with lua, which remains my favorite script
            language to this day, and then learned some C#, and now with LBCC I've learned Java.</p>
            <p>I have a HAM license (Technician class, for those wondering) which means I get to talk
            on air using radios with a bunch of other HAM operators. This also allows me to use said
            radios for most things from chit-chat across Oregon to experimenting with designs. HAM radio
            operators are also expected to lend a hand to the community should there ever be a state of
            emergency (ie: flooding or earthquakes). I am hoping to upgrade my license to a general
            class license within a year's time.</p>
            <p>I also have two projects I'm trying to work on during
            this quarter, which are:
            <ul>
                <li>An arduino project to measure impedance.</li>
                <li>My PH212 project, which for me is to make a rangefinder and figure out how big it
                would need to be to measure the distance to the moon.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
