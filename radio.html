                I have a few hobbies, but as of late I have really been sinking time into HAM radios.
                For those of you who don't know, HAM radios (as opposed to normal radios) are just radios
                which operate on a frequency which HAM operators are lisenced to use.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a saying among HAMs which is what HAM means. It is actually an acryonym, and
                most HAMs agree that it stands for "Had Alot of Money." This is because HAM radios are
                expensive, really expenseive, in fact, they are too expensive. A good radio rig will run
                for about anywhere from $200.00 to the nice and capable rigs around $2,000.00
            </p>
            <p>
                Something that has fascinated me for a long time is the conversion of various things,
                such as images or text, into audio formats. Naturally when I found out that a local
                repeater runs an hour long meet using this method to give eachother images, I jumped
                on the software to decode them. Now there are many different formats to encode with,
                but the most common on this repeater is <b>Scottie 1</b>. Below is an image I encoded
                using Scottie 1:<br>
                <audio controls="controls" id="encodedScottie1">
                    <source src="medias/HelloScottie_Quiet.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
                    <source src="medias/HelloScottie_Quiet.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
                    Your browser does not support Vorbis Ogg audio or MP3s.
                </audio>
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course with real world factors, you pick up radiation and static interferience
                when the image is sent across the air, and images end up looking a little something
                like this, on a good day:<br>
                <img id="sstv" src="images/scottie1example.jpg" alt="An image with sparatic discolorations">
            </p>
            <p>
                It should be noted, however, that this image was artifically polluted by noise, real world noise
                in an image is not this kind to images, especially at a distance.<br><br>
            </p>

                A part of radios which could be considered class is the morse code. Nothing but a bunch
                of dits and dahs to represent an entire train of thought or converstation.
                I want to learn how to use CW (the mode used for morse code) but first I need to 
                actually learn morse code and then get a radio which can use this mode, such as the
                FT-757GX below.

            <p>
                <br><br>And by the way, AM and FM are <b>not</b> frequencies, they are modes of transmission.
                Now you can go impress everyone! Or sound like a jerk by correcting them.
