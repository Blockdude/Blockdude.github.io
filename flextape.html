                        <p>
                            The <abbr title="Fighter / Attack">F/A</abbr>-18A was a development of
                            the YF-17. The F/A-18A's first flight was on the 18th of November in
                            1978. It was approved for full production by the U.S. Military in 1983.</p>
                        <p>The F/A-18C begin being manufactued in
                            september 1987 and is still used by the <abbr title="United States Marine Corps">USMC</abbr>
                            today.</p>
                    <h2 id="Radar">Radar</h2>
                        <P>The F/A-18A/B variants were equipt with the
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AN/APG-65">AN/APG-65</a> radar.</P>
                        <p>The F/A-18C/D variant's radars were replaced and the C/Ds were given the
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AN/APG-73">AN/APG-73</a>. This same
                            radar is present in proceeding variants of the F/A-18.</p>

                        <p>The cockpit of the F/A-18 has 3 screens, the lower one of which shows
                            navigational data. The other two are hooked to the onboard computer which
                            allows the pilot to make them display whatever they need in that moment,
                            such as the radar, weapon selection, or the targeting pod.</p>

                        <p>Every F/A-18 is control by the computer from the pilot's joystick input.
                            That is to say that without power, you have no ability to fly or glide.</p>
                        <p>Every other Hornet variant (B,D and F) are dual-seat aircraft with the
                            pilot up front and a pilot filling a <abbr title="Weapon Systems Officer">WSO</abbr>
                            role directly behind them.</p>

                            engines. These engines along with the weight of the aircraft allows it to
                            take off with a gross weight of 51900lbs. Its typical deployment T/O weight
                            is 44000lbs for comparison, and 24000lbs when just the aircraft and fuel is weighed.</p>
